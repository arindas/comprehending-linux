# Comprehending Linux

by [Arindam Das](https://github.com/arindas)

> [!WARNING]  
> This book is still a work in progress. All the planned sections are not yet completed.

> **Comprehending Linux** aims to bridge the gap between operating systems
> theory and the actual mainline Linux kernel source tree. We focus
> on the kernel internals and how they work together to efficiently
> utilize the underlying hardware, in a comprehensive manner.
>
> We plan to cover all the essential topics ranging from booting up, system calls,
> filesystems, networking to kernel debugging with kprobes, kgdb and developing
> linux kernel modules and device drivers.
>
> New Linux kernel features like `eBPF`, `io_uring` and `SCHED_EXT` are also given
> special emphasis - we plan to go into detail on:
>
> - Asynchronous IO with `io_uring`
> - Software Defined Networking (SDN) and tracing with `eBPF`
> - Custom schedulers with `SCHED_EXT`
