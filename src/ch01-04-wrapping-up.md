# Getting Started: Wrapping Up

This section covered the following:

- Fetch kernel sources from the official kernel.org tarballs
- Configure kernel build
- Build kernel rootfs initramfs
- Run kernel image with initramfs on QEMU
- Build Kernel with debug info
- Run Kernel on QEMU with GDB debugger

This chapter showed you the general workflows for working with the Linux kernel. Regardless of what we do, it
is important to run through these steps since they will be essential for any custom kernel development.

It's completely fine to have a lot unanswered questions right now, like "What are system calls?" or
"What is a bootloader?" We have the rest of the book to answer them!

> There are a lot of operating systems texts that cover the latter topics in great detail, but it's hard to come
> across any resource which contains the latest workflow for building and debugging the kernel.
> This is why I chose to start with these workflows instead. In a way it also makes introducing
> several topics easier since we come across in some form or shape in this section.
