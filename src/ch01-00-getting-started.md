# Getting Started

Here's the plan:

- Prepare our environment for building the Linux kernel and running it in a VM
- Grab kernel sources from the official Linux kernel archives: <https://https://www.kernel.org/>
- Build the linux kernel from sources
- Run our linux kernel build in a VM with a debugger attached

This is a great starting point as it grounds our activities to the mainline source tree
and to real world Linux kernel development. Don't worry if you aren't able to form a mental
picture of what exactly we are about to do, we will see it together.
