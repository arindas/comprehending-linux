# Comprehending Linux

by [Arindam Das](https://github.com/arindas)

> **Comprehending Linux** aims to bridge the gap between operating systems
> theory and the actual mainline Linux kernel source tree. We focus
> on the kernel internals and how they work together to efficiently
> utilize the underlying hardware, in a comprehensive manner.
>
> We cover a variety of topics ranging from booting up, system calls,
> filesystems, networking to kernel debugging with kprobes, kgdb and developing device drivers.
>
> New Linux kernel features like `eBPF`, `io_uring` and `SCHED_EXT` are also given
> special emphasis - we go into detail on asynchronous IO with `io_uring`, SDN and
> tracing with `eBPF` and custom schedulers with `SCHED_EXT`.
